function R = modR(R)
%--------------------------------------------------------------
% modR replaces NaNs with zeros and ensures the diagonal of a matrix is 1
% This is done because most large datasets will have some variables that
% are zero throughout and this results in NaNs etc. This method allows us
% to pre-treat the correlation matrix and render it suitable for sampling purposes.

    for j = 1:NVar
